Spotify Data Analysis
Capstone project for BS in Computer Science

This is a data analysis of Spotify songs. I used a Jupyter Notebook, Python, pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn to create several visualizations and a predictor tool.
The predictor tool used machine learning to allow users to input values for certain Spotify metrics. The tool would then predict whether a song would reach the Spotify Top 100.
